            Hi! I'm Josh, and I'm currently a freshman in the Magnet Program at Montgomery Blair High School.
			<br />
			<br />
			I'm interested in many activities, but my favorites are anything related to computers, especially cybersecurity. I enjoy video games and manga when I'm bored.
			<br />
			<br />
			I've also gotten pretty into ham radio and R/C flying before, and still hold a General class Amateur Radio FCC license and a fixed-wing certification from <a href="https://dc-rc.org">DC/RC</a>.

				<div class="hidden" id="ctf">
					Capture-the-flags, also known as CTFs, are competitions where players exploit systems to retrieve a string, called the flag. The flag is then submitted for points.
					<br />
					<br />
					Currently, I play with <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/36439">b1c</a> and <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/109452">DiceGang</a> (formerly <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/105365">okay blue</a>).
					<br />
					Recently, I helped organize <a href="https://2020.angstromctf.com">Ã¥ngstromCTF 2020</a>, a high school cybersecurity competition.
					<br />
					<br />
					You can find solutions to some challenges that I've done <a href="https://github.com/joshdabosh/writeups">here</a>.
					<br />
					<br />
					I was also captain of a former team of Blair freshmen, <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/57840">One Hundo Percent Not FBI</a>, and founded it in 7th grade with some friends, though we went under a different name then.
					<br />
					<br />
					When a smaller CTF comes around and my other teams aren't participating, I sometimes play with <a href="https://rgbsec.xyz">RGBsec</a>.
