            Hi! I'm Josh, and I'm currently a 	CS student at Georgia Tech. I'm interested in many activities, but my favorites are anything related to computers, especially cybersecurity. I've also taken an interest in learning more about pure math.
			<br />
			<br />
			This fall, I'm working as an undergraduate researcher in the Systems Software and Security Lab. I'm also a project manager at the GT Web Development Club, building a centralized campus-wide review system.
			<br />
			<br />
			For the past two summers, I've been a software engineering intern at Lockheed Martin. I'm also leading a research project at the University of Maryland's Breakerspace, under Professor Dave Levin.
			<br />
			<br />
			In my free time, I compete in cybersecurity competitions called Capture-the-Flags, or CTFs for short. I currently play for <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/109452">DiceGang</a>, the highest ranked team in the U.S.
			<br />
			<br />
			Previously, I was named a <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/2023-scholars/">2023 Regeneron Science Talent Search Scholar</a> for <i>AutoPower: Detecting IoT Malware with Power Measurements</i>, which I worked on at the Breakerspace from 2021-22. I was also selected as an Atlas Finalist in 2023, being in the top 200 of over 18,000 applicants.
			<br />
			<br />
			In high school, I was the captain of the <a href="https://blairsec.mbhs.edu">Cybersecurity Club</a> and <a href="https://compteam.mbhs.edu">Computer Team</a>, as well as a member of the Blair SysOps and the ultimate frisbee team.
