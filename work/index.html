                    <h3 class="subtitle is-4">Sourcing Neutrinos to Blazars</h3>
                    <p>A program that can accurately identify what blazar is most likely to have originated a collection of neutrinos, given a collection of those neutrino events. This was my partner and I's entry into the 2018-19 Montgomery County Science Fair. We won 2nd place in Physics, as well as a number of other community awards, such as awards from the American Nuclear Society and the Nuclear Regulatory Commitee.</p>

                    <p>This site, joshwang.me, was coded and designed by me. It is hosted with NameCheap and GitHub. Its alternate link is joshdabosh.github.io, which will just redirect you back to this site's landing page.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle is-4">PlusMinus</h3>
                    <p>A website based on a game I learned during a Game Theory class at a math camp. Players take turns marking either 1 or 2 dashes with a line, and the first player that cannot make another valid move loses. The site features a NoSQL database using Google's FireBase RealTime database, and is written in Flask. The site is hosted on Heroku, where all important credentials are kept as config vars as well as my local mahcine.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle is-4">PorchJokes</h3>
                    <p>A jokes board I originally for submissions to Mr. Porch's Joke of the Day. It is a Flask web application and I used an SSH request-forwarding service called serveo to get a subdomain. The MySQL server is run locally.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle is-4">TPMSMusic</h3>
                    <p>A website some friends and I put together. Our band director had some issues with communication with parents and students, and was interested if some of her students could make a website for announcements and file sharing. The backend is written in Flask, and the site itself is hosted on Heroku. It uses a FireBase NoSQL database for both posts and user credentials.</p>

                    <p>An automated backpack that I entered into the 2017-18 Montgomery County Science Fair. The project won Honorable Mention in the Engineering Category. I presented this project at the 2017-18 Montgomery County Agricultural Fair, and won Grand Champion in the STEM Category. The code is run on a Raspberry Pi. Power and sensor signals are handled through a breadboard.</p>
